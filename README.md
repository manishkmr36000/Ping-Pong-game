# Ping-Pong-game

In this code, the HTML structure defines a canvas element for the game screen.

The CSS styles are used to center the canvas and give it a background color and border.

JavaScript is used to create game objects such as the paddles and ball, and to handle their movement, collisions, and rendering.

The game loop function gameLoop() updates the game objects and renders them on the canvas at a frame rate of 60 frames per second.

You can save this code in an HTML file and open it in a web browser to play the Ping Pong game. The player controls the left paddle with the W and S keys, while the computer-controlled paddle moves automatically. The ball bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom walls, and the goal is to keep the ball from reaching the player's side.
